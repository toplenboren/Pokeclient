> A quick application which displays pokemons from pokeapi

Built using:
* CRA
* MaterialUI

* UseSWR

## Usage:

Just go to the playground and try it live :)


## Local launch:

I assume you have got `npm` or `yarn` installed
 
run `yarn` or `npm install` <- this will install a load of dependencies

then run `yarn start` or `npm start` <- this will start a project on `localhost:3000`
